 Population contains individual genomes

 Genomes contain two sets of genes:
 1. The node genes, each which describes a single neuron
 2. The connection genes between neurons


 Fitness function
 Computes a single real number indicating the quality of the solution
 Higher score = better (maximization)


 Number of generations is user-specified

 Each generation is created through reproduction, (crossover) and mutation


 Reproduction and mutation:
 May add or remove nodes and/or connections
 This increases/decreases complexity



 algorithm terminates if convergence is achieved
 OR if we reach final number of generations
 OR if we reach max fitness criterion . Algorithm terminates


 Implementation of crossover is difficult
 How do we crossover networks with different strcutures?
 NEAT tacks the origin of the nodse witha n identifying number
 NEw, higher numbers are generated for each additional node
 Those that are derived from a common ancestor(That are homogenous) are matched up for crossover
 Connections are matched if the nodes they connect have  common ancestry

 Another difficulty: Structural mutation (i.e wights of the connections)
 NEAT divides genomes into species which have a close genomic distance
 Genomic distance is measured as a combination of the number of non-homologous nodes and connections with measures of how much homogenous nodes and connections ahve diverged
 Non-homogenous nodes and connections are termed "Disjoint" or "excess"
